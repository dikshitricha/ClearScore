# ClearScore iOS Technical Test

### Description
We would like to see how well you write iOS apps to represent real concepts and problems.
Notes:

There is no 100% correct answer. Make any decisions you feel are sensible. â€¨

You can use any frameworks you like but write about why you chose it.
Your code must be documented, compile and be testable by us. At the end, please push any code you have written to GitHub or Bitbucket and then send us a link to the repository.
Write an application that will display a donut view which pulls the credit score information from the endpoint given. The wire frame shows an example of what is to be achieved.
The donut should display the correct value received from the endpoint and use that value to fill the outline of the donut but the same percentage.

The endpoint:
**https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.clearscore.com/native/interview_test/creditReportInfo.json**


# Development

### Summary

I have developed this app using MVVM architecture.
Though the test mentioned that we can use any third party library, I decided not to use any just to show my understanding and knowledge.

Though if I were to use any libraries, I would choose to use Alamofire for networking and AEConicalGradient or AngleGradientLayer for the getting a nice gradient on the circle.

I have tried keeping the project structure clean and organised.
